# Configure Spree Preferences
#
# Note: Initializing preferences available within the Admin will overwrite any changes that were made through the user interface when you restart.
#       If you would like users to be able to update a setting with the Admin it should NOT be set here.
#
# Note: If a preference is set here it will be stored within the cache & database upon initialization.
#       Just removing an entry from this initializer will not make the preference value go away.
#       Instead you must either set a new value or remove entry, clear cache, and remove database entry.
#
# In order to initialize a setting do:
# config.setting_name = 'new value'
Spree.config do |config|
  # Example:
  # Uncomment to stop tracking inventory levels in the application
  config.track_inventory_levels = false
  config.use_s3 = true
  config.s3_bucket = ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME']
  config.s3_access_key = ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']
  config.s3_secret = ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
end
